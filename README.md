Introduction

Hello, my name is Cristiam Enciso and welcome to my Inventory Manager application! In order to get started go ahead and run the program to get it started. Once open you’ll notice that Inventory list starts off empty as a standard and needs to be filled up manually.

Adding Items

In order to add a new item to the list simply fill the text fields on the right side of the GUI with the desired name of the item, dollar amount of the item (without a dollar sign), and a serial number, once all fields are full, click on the ‘Add Item’ button to add the item to the list. In order to successfully log an item to the list all entered items must have a name, a dollar value and a serial number. Furthermore, the name must be between 2 and 256 characters inclusively, dollar values must be greater than or equal to 0, and serial numbers must be unique and duplicates of other item serial numbers as well as following the required format: A-XXX-XXX-XXX where the first character is a letter followed by either a letter or a number, non-case sensitive.

Removing items

In order to remove an individual item from the list simply select an item by clicking on it with your mouse. Once highlighted click on the ‘Remove Item’ button to remove the selected item. To remove all items simply click on the ‘Remove All’ button.

Editing Items

To edit any property of an item, first you must select an item from the list by clicking it, once highlighted you can decide what property to edit by filling out the field with the desired update and then click on the ‘Edit’ button to update the item. The application allows you update the name, dollar value, and serial number at the same time or independently of each other. However just like adding a new item, the item name, dollar value and serial number must follow the required prerequisites. Where the name must be between 2 and 256 characters inclusively, dollar values must be greater than or equal to 0, and serial numbers must be unique and duplicates of other item serial numbers as well as following the required format: A-XXX-XXX-XXX where the first character is a letter followed by either a letter or a number, non-case sensitive. If these requirements are not met the fields will not update.

Sorting Items

The application allows for sorting of items on the list by either name, dollar amount, or serial number. To do so simply click on the column header for the respective property in order to change the sorting order.

Searching for an Item

You can search on an item by its name or serial number by inputting the desired search criteria on the search bar on the very top of the application GUI. It is a dynamic list so the list will update without having to submit the search and will update as you enter the search criteria. To return to the original list, clear the search bar.
